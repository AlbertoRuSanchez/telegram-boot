### ¿Why this project?

This project has been made just for fun and in order to practice with third parties with springboot. This is not even 100% functional for final user, but i am sure that it reached the purpose for me. Learn&fun while coding, thats all. Well, and of course, if it is useful for anyone who want to know how Telegram bots works with spring, for sure they can find some value information here.

### ¿What is it about?

It is a little and simple Springboot app that serves as backend for a Telegram bot. This Telegram bot can be used to translate text from english to spanish.

To use the bot you just have to:

- Have installed Telegram
- Search the conversation translator_telegram_bot
- /start (this app must be running, obviously)
- Write text in english, and it will be sent to the app. This text will be translated from Google Translator.
- Write translated text to the bot conversation.
